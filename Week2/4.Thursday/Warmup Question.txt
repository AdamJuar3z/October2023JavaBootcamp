Write a Java program that does the following:

    Create a Student class with the following properties:
	First Name, Last Name, StudentID, 
        Year In College (1-4, 1 is Freshman, 2 is Sophomore, 3 is Junior and 4 is Senior)
        Whether or not they're an international Student
	Address (Street # and Street Name)

    Create all getters and setters for the properties

    Create a constructor that takes in ALL properties of the Student.

    Create -another- constructor that ONLY takes in the First Name, Last Name, and StudentID

    Create a method in the Student class called "greeting" where the student introduces themselves.
    Ex: "Hi my name is Bob Smith!"
    (Hint, there's more than 1 way to accomplish this)
