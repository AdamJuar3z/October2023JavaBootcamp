Warmup Question 
Create a Java class named Student with the following attributes:

    name (String)
    age (int)
    grade (double)

Implement the following in the Student class:

    Create a constructor that initializes the name, age, and grade attributes.
    Implement getter methods for each attribute (getName, getAge, getGrade).
    Implement setter methods for each attribute (setName, setAge, setGrade).
    Create a custom method named isPassing that returns true if the grade attribute is greater than or equal to 70 and false otherwise.

In your Main class, create an instance of the Student class, set its attributes, and use the getter and custom method to display information about whether the student is passing.
