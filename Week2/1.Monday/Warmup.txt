Instructions:


    Inside the main method, do the following:

    a. Create a Scanner object to read user input. You will need to import the java.util.Scanner class at the beginning of your program.

    b. Prompt the user to enter their numerical score by displaying the message: "Enter your numerical score: "

    c. Read the user's input as an integer and store it in a variable (e.g., score).

    d. Use if else statements to determine the letter grade based on the following scoring system:
        Scores between 90 and 100 (inclusive) should be assigned the grade "A."
        Scores between 80 and 89 (inclusive) should be assigned the grade "B."
        Scores between 70 and 79 (inclusive) should be assigned the grade "C."
        Scores between 60 and 69 (inclusive) should be assigned the grade "D."
        Scores below 60 should be assigned the grade "F."

    e. Print the corresponding letter grade to the console.

    Close the Scanner object after you've finished using it.

    Test your program by running it and entering different numerical scores. Make sure it provides the correct letter grades for each score.

    Once you've completed the program and tested it thoroughly, you're done!
