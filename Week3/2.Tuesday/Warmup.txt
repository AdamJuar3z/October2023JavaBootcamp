Warmup Question - Handling an Exception:
Write a Java program that does the following:

    Asks the user to enter a number.
    Attempt to parse the user's input into an integer using Integer.parseInt().
    Use a try-catch block to handle the possible NumberFormatException that can occur if the user enters something that cannot be parsed as an integer.
    If the parsing is successful, print the square of the entered number. If an exception occurs, print an error message.
